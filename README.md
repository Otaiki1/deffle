# 🤔 Existing Problem

The fundamental problem with traditional lottery platforms is that they have numerous inefficiencies that lead to a great deal of mistrust between platform lottery hosts, developers, and players. The traditional lottery system is further hampered by high scale costs and subpar user experiences.Players may also experience difficulties with tiny and infrequent payouts, a lack of social contact, hidden fees, and a high danger of fraud. The cost of organization, lack of support for blockchain protocols, inability to offer enormous prizes, and very expensive licensing procedures are some of the most significant problems for enterprises and organizations.

**This is not a simple matter**
Issues like the mcdonald lottery scheme show how scandalous the system can be
The lottery industry is a very lucrative industry , trust in ongoing lottery games have waned and for the industry to thrive , people need to see transparent trustworthy raffle systems .


# 🥳 LuckyBlock

LuckyBlock is a solution to this problem by creating an easy to use platform that allows people create transparent trustworthy raffle lotteries on the blockchain , earn from their raffles and also give users trust that the lottery isnt being manipulated at any point in time


# LuckyBlock contract

This is the LuckyBlock contract, a smart contract for managing a decentralized lottery creation system on the Polygon blockchain.

## Features

- Secure and transparent: all lottery operations are recorded on the blockchain and can be verified by anyone.

- Fair: the winner is chosen randomly and transparently using a verifiable random function.

- Flexible: the contract allows for customization of the lottery parameters, such as the ticket price and the pool size.

## Usage

To use the LuckyBlock contract, you will need a Polygon wallet and some MATIC to pay for the transaction fees.

1. First, deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a suitable Polygon wallet or dApp.

2. Create a raffle by triggering the create raffle function and setting a passCode

3. The raffle can be accessed using its id and the passcode , and an entry is gotten by calling the enter raffle function 

4. Once the deadline for purchasing tickets for that particular raffle has passed and atleast 1 person enters the raffle, the contract will use a verifiable random function to choose the winner randomly and transparently.

5. The winner gets their prize sent to them automatically.

## 👨‍🔬 How is this a solution?

LuckyBlock is not governed by an organisation but by an immutable code (cannot be changed once deployed) displayed publicly so that there need not to be an authority to handle and oversee the whole lottery process, The winners are also picked randomly by using chainlink. This means, the lottery can happen in a way that it **cannot** be manipulated, but would pay winners and allow people participated depending on the conditions provided when creating the smart contract (the immutable code that governs the tickets - NFTs).

## ☄️ Stack Used
- [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) enables us to deploy contracts in L2 blockchain which helps handle traffic for the rush in the event in buying tickets. 

- [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) decentralized blockchain oracle network built on Ethereum. Enables us to generate transparent randomness to allow FAIRNESS in winner selection process



## ☄️ What's next for LuckyBlock?

LuckyBlock would introduce payment APIs to ensure seamless funding from card to crypto to ensure smooth payment procedures.
