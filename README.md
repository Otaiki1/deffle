# 🤔 Existing Problem

The fundamental problem with traditional lottery platforms is that they have numerous inefficiencies that lead to a great deal of mistrust between platform lottery hosts, developers, and players. The traditional lottery system is further hampered by high scale costs and subpar user experiences.Players may also experience difficulties with tiny and infrequent payouts, a lack of social contact, hidden fees, and a high danger of fraud. The cost of organization, lack of support for blockchain protocols, inability to offer enormous prizes, and very expensive licensing procedures are some of the most significant problems for enterprises and organizations.

This has been going for 20+ years in the Football League. There are news of fans getting abused, attacked and killed because of tickets touting. To end this issue, the Federation needs a solution that does not exist to this problem, *or does it?*

# 🥳 DEFFLE

Deffle is a solution to this problem by creating an easy to use platform that allows people create transparent trustworthy raffle lotteries on the blockchain , earn from their raffles and also give users trust that the lottery isnt being manipulated at any point in time

## 🕵️ What are NFTs?

NFTs stand for Non-Fungible Tokens. They are unique on its own with different attributes per token that exists within a blockchain.
-->
## 👨‍🔬 How is this a solution?

Deffle is not governed by an organisation but by an immutable code (cannot be changed once deployed) displayed publicly so that there need not to be an authority to handle and oversee the whole lottery process, The winners are also picked randomly by using chainlink. This means, the lottery can happen in a way that it **cannot** be manipulated, but would pay winners and allow people participated depending on the conditions provided when creating the smart contract (the immutable code that governs the tickets - NFTs).

## ☄️ What's next for NFTicket?

NFTs are the way to go forward in every game/sport industry as each ticket can be controlled without a physical entity. We aim to make our project better using tools that will futher enhance this project to be viable on actual production enviornment in actually games. 
In other words, think of a time where you can genuinly buy tickets for the inital price than overpriced secondary sales ; we're getting there.

## ⚡ Hackathon

This project was made for [Polygon Africa Bootcamp hackathon](https://polygon.technology/africa-bootcamp/) 
<!-- targetting the following bounties :

- [SKALE](https://skale.space/) enables us to build a linear scaling zero gas fee dapp which can expand should we need more resources, and in events where we need to build more products. While this is still Work in Progress, we intend to move the entire application into [SKALE](https://skale.space/) where it will be gas-free and easily scalable according to traffic and requirement.

- [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) enables us to index tickets that were sold, and listed for re-fund or re-sell using events which are gas-friendly ; efficiently.

- [Valist](https://www.valist.io/) enables us to deploy the dapp (web frontend) in a decentralized environment making sure that the website will not crash under any circumstances.

- [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) enables us to deploy contracts in L2 blockchain which helps handle traffic for the rush in the event in buying tickets.
